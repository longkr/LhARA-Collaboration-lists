LhARA proposal author list ...

Claire,  I’m tidying the author list for the LhARA proposal — I’ve just added you to it.  Dion was gathering names before the break, she’ll pick it up again on her return.  The entry so far is:

Dr	Claire	Hardiman	C.	claire.hardiman@nhs.net	C. Hardiman	RadPhys-Rbio-IC-NHS	Dept. Radiation Physics and Radiobiology, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK

Hope this is OK ...
