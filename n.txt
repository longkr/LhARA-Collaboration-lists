LhARA proposal author list ...

Aaron,

I’m tidying the author list for the LhARA proposal — I’ve just added you to it.  Dion was gathering names before the break, she’ll pick it up again on her return.  The entry in our database so far reads:

Dr	Aaron	Knoll	A.	a.knoll@IMPERIAL.AC.UK	A. Knoll	Aero-ICL	Department of Aeronautics, Department of Physics, Imperial College London, Exhibition Road, London SW7 2AZ, UK

Please do drop me a line with corrections updates etc.
